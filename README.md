### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vegard. I like to tinker with all things programming-related, whether it's SAT solvers, the Linux kernel, shadertoy, fuzzing, compilers, or console hacking.

Feel free to get in touch by [email](mailto:vegard.nossum@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vegard_no), I'm happy to hear from people and help out where I can!
